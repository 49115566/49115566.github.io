It can feel like worry, nervousness, or a sense that something bad might happen—even if you’re not sure why. Almost everyone experiences anxiety at some point, and it doesn’t mean you’re weak or broken. In fact, a little anxiety can sometimes help you prepare for challenges, like a big meeting or a tough conversation.\n\nBut anxiety can become a problem when it sticks around, even after the stress is gone, or when it makes daily life harder. You might notice racing thoughts, trouble sleeping, a tight chest, or avoiding things that make you nervous.\n\nMyth-buster: Anxiety isn’t “all in your head.” It’s a real, whole-body experience, and you’re not alone in feeling it. Ever notice your mind jumping to worst-case scenarios, or your body feeling tense for no clear reason? That’s anxiety showing up." }

Notice if your shoulders drop or your heartbeat slows, even a little.

Maybe you finished a task, heard a song you like, or just got out of bed. Give yourself credit for each one.\n\nOr, if you’d rather, take a mindful moment:\nSit quietly, close your eyes if that feels safe, and take a slow breath in. Notice the feeling of the air, the sounds around you, or the way your body feels in the chair. You don’t have to change anything—just notice.\n\nRemember, you don’t have to do this perfectly. Every small step is a win. Here’s a gentle reminder to carry with you:\n\n“This too shall pass. Even on the hardest days, I am worthy of care and small kindnesses. I don’t have to do it all at once—one gentle step at a time is enough.”\n\nIf you’d like more support, you can sign up for our platform to access guided journals, mood trackers, and video courses.
